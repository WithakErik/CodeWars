### Task

Write a function named isNice/IsNice that returns true if its array argument is a Nice array, else false. You should also return false if input array has no elements.

### Notes
A Nice array is defined to be an array where for every value n in the array, there is also an element n-1 or n+1 in the array.

# Process
Chris and I drew up some ideas on the white boards then began to code. We kept getting stuck until Ryan came in and enlightened us that the pairs were not mutually exclusive. Then we threw more ideas up on the white boards, hacked away at our computers, then prevailed to pass all the tests!
