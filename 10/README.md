# Problem
NA

### Task
As a part of this Kata, you need to create a function that when provided with a triplet, returns the index of the numerical element that lies between the other two elements.

### Notes
The input to the function will be an array of three distinct numbers (Haskell: a tuple).

# Process
I read the instructions and thought "indexOf, sort (on a concat), [1]" Then I wrote some code, tested it, and passed first try! whoohoo!
