# Problem
ATM machines allow 4 or 6 digit PIN codes and PIN codes cannot contain anything but exactly 4 digits or exactly 6 digits.

### Task
If the function is passed a valid PIN string, return true, else return false.

### Notes
I didn't white board because I had already left the school by the time this was assigned.

# Process
I've been playing around with RegEx on that RegEx x-word site I posted to the Ryver so I had an idea of how to go about filtering out the false entries. I had to do a little research then tried a few things until I passed.
