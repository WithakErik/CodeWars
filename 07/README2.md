# Problem

### Task
Given a string, capitalize the letters that occupy even indexes and odd indexes separately, and return as shown below. Index 0 will be considered even.


### Notes
For example, capitalize("abcdef") = ['AbCdEf', 'aBcDeF']. See test cases for more examples.

The input will be a lowercase string with no spaces.

# Process
This one took under around a minute to solve. Eye read the destructions and thought "Hay, I kneed to banana-split the received shoe-string into an array-Charles, then pirate-map it out to blank-check if the inDex-ters-Laboratory is an even-Stevens number with a ternary operator that will ether return-turn-turn a value-mart toUpperCase-closed() or unchanged. Then do that again but opposite."
