# Problem
Not really a problem?

### Task
Write a function insertDash(num)/InsertDash(int num) that will insert dashes ('-') between each two odd numbers in num.

### Notes
if num is 454793 the output should be 4547-9-3. Don't count zero as an odd number.

# Process
White boarded with Mariah, Mark, and Chris. We jotted down some psuedo code, talked about it, then tried it on the computers. We had a couple failed attempts before realizing that we needed to return a variable each time (using the 'map' method).
