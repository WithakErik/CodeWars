# Problem
You're at the zoo... all the meerkats look weird. Something has gone terribly wrong - someone has gone and switched their heads and tails around!

### Task
Save the animals by switching them back. You will be given an array which will have three values (tail, body, head). It is your job to re-arrange the array so that the animal is the right way round (head, body, tail).

### Notes
Same goes for all the other arrays/lists that you will get in the tests: you have to change the element positions with the same exact logics - simples!

# Process
Robyn and I read the problem, looked at the inputted data, then I instantly knew that a .reverse() would suffice. It took us less than a minute.
